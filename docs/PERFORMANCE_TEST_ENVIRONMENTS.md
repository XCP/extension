# Test Environment Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary
Switching pure unit tests from `happy-dom` to `node` environment shows **minimal performance improvement** (~0.5-1s faster on average).

## Test Setup
- **Test Files**: 5 pure unit tests (188 total test cases)
  - `encryption.test.ts` - Cryptographic operations
  - `walletEncryption.test.ts` - Wallet crypto functions  
  - `format.test.ts` - String formatting utilities
  - `numeric.test.ts` - Number operations
  - `settingsStorage.test.ts` - Storage operations

## Performance Results

### With Node Environment
```
Run 1: Duration 1.68s (environment 1ms)
Run 2: Duration 2.94s (environment 2ms)
Run 3: Duration 2.89s (environment 2ms)
Average: ~2.50s
```

### With Happy-DOM Environment  
```
Run 1: Duration 2.81s (environment 1ms)
Run 2: Duration 3.25s (environment 2ms)
Run 3: Duration 2.39s (environment 3ms)
Average: ~2.82s
```

## Analysis

### Performance Difference
- **Node environment**: ~2.50s average
- **Happy-DOM environment**: ~2.82s average
- **Improvement**: ~0.32s (11% faster)

### Surprising Finding
The `environment` setup time is nearly identical (1-3ms) for both! This suggests:
1. Happy-DOM is very lightweight
2. The overhead is minimal for tests that don't use DOM APIs
3. Most time is spent in transform, setup, and test execution

### Time Breakdown (typical run)
```
Transform: ~1.5s (TypeScript compilation)
Setup: ~2.0s (Test framework initialization)
Collect: ~2.5s (Loading test files)
Tests: ~200ms (Actual test execution)
Environment: ~2ms (DOM/Node setup)
Prepare: ~1.5s (Vitest preparation)
```

## Recommendations

### Keep Happy-DOM Globally
The performance gain from switching is minimal (~0.3s for 188 tests). The benefits of consistency outweigh the small performance gain:
- **Simplicity**: One configuration for all tests
- **Maintainability**: No need to remember which tests need which environment
- **Flexibility**: Tests can add DOM operations without changing config

### When to Use Node Environment
Only consider `@vitest-environment node` for:
1. **Heavy computation tests** with thousands of iterations
2. **Benchmark suites** where milliseconds matter
3. **CI/CD optimization** when running thousands of tests

### Current Optimization
If you want to optimize these 5 files, add to each:
```typescript
// @vitest-environment node
```

But the gain is only ~0.3s for 188 tests (~1.6ms per test).

## Files That Could Use Node Environment

Based on analysis, these test files never use DOM and could run in Node:
- All encryption tests (`src/utils/encryption/__tests__/*`)
- All pure utility tests (`src/utils/__tests__/*`)
- Storage tests that don't render (`src/utils/storage/__tests__/*`)
- Blockchain utility tests (`src/utils/blockchain/*/__tests__/*`)

Total potential files: ~30-40 files
Estimated time savings: 1-2 seconds total

## Conclusion

The performance difference between `happy-dom` and `node` environments is **negligible** for pure unit tests. The 11% improvement (~0.3s for 188 tests) doesn't justify the added complexity of mixed environments.

**Recommendation**: Keep the global `happy-dom` configuration for simplicity unless the test suite grows significantly larger or performance becomes a critical issue.
