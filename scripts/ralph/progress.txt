## Codebase Patterns
- Hook test files are in src/hooks/__tests__/*.test.ts
- Use Usefulness Score = Impact × Probability to evaluate test value
- Tests that only verify React behavior (cleanup, initial state) are low value
- Threshold: Score < 15 = REMOVE, 15-29 = REVIEW, ≥30 = KEEP

## 2026-01-21 - US-001: Audit Hook Tests for Usefulness
- What was implemented:
  - Read and analyzed all 10 hook test files (78 tests total)
  - Calculated Usefulness Score for each test
  - Created tasks/cleanup-hooks.md with complete analysis
- Files changed:
  - tasks/cleanup-hooks.md (created)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Many hook tests include "cleanup on unmount without errors" tests that just verify React's behavior, not our logic (Score ~6)
  - Hook tests that verify data transformation (e.g., UTXO formatting, balance conversion) are high value
  - Tests that only check initial state (null, empty array) are low value
  - Security-related hooks (useAuthGuard, useIdleTimer) have highest scores
  - 9 tests marked for removal, 19 for review, 60 to keep
