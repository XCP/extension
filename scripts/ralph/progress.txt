## Codebase Patterns
- Hook test files are in src/hooks/__tests__/*.test.ts
- Service test files are in src/services/__tests__/*.test.ts and src/services/core/__tests__/*.test.ts
- Validation test files are in src/utils/validation/__tests__/*.test.ts (exclude *.fuzz.test.ts for non-fuzz analysis)
- Storage test files are in src/utils/storage/__tests__/*.test.ts
- Use Usefulness Score = Impact × Probability to evaluate test value
- Tests that only verify React behavior (cleanup, initial state) are low value
- Tests that only verify mock returns mock value are low value (over-mocked)
- Threshold: Score < 15 = REMOVE, 15-29 = REVIEW, ≥30 = KEEP
- Security-related tests (authorization, input validation) tend to score highest
- Best assertion pattern for validation: `expect(result).toEqual({ isValid: false, error: 'specific message' })`
- session.test.ts is the gold standard for validation test assertions
- mutex.test.ts is exemplary for concurrency-critical code testing
- walletStorage.test.ts has excellent validation tests for data integrity
- Tests using `fakeBrowser` from wxt/testing are preferred over manual mocks

## 2026-01-21 - US-001: Audit Hook Tests for Usefulness
- What was implemented:
  - Read and analyzed all 10 hook test files (78 tests total)
  - Calculated Usefulness Score for each test
  - Created tasks/cleanup-hooks.md with complete analysis
- Files changed:
  - tasks/cleanup-hooks.md (created)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Many hook tests include "cleanup on unmount without errors" tests that just verify React's behavior, not our logic (Score ~6)
  - Hook tests that verify data transformation (e.g., UTXO formatting, balance conversion) are high value
  - Tests that only check initial state (null, empty array) are low value
  - Security-related hooks (useAuthGuard, useIdleTimer) have highest scores
  - 9 tests marked for removal, 19 for review, 60 to keep

## 2026-01-21 - US-002: Audit Service Tests for Usefulness
- What was implemented:
  - Read and analyzed all 10 service test files (~138 tests total)
  - Calculated Usefulness Score for each test
  - Created tasks/cleanup-services.md with complete analysis
- Files changed:
  - tasks/cleanup-services.md (created)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - walletService.test.ts is problematic - all 24 tests only verify mock behavior (mock returns mock value), provides false confidence
  - Security tests in providerService.security.test.ts are well-written and score highest (70-80)
  - eventEmitterService has good coverage with meaningful assertions
  - Some tests have empty bodies (Event Emissions test) or just comments (Rate Limiting)
  - Constructor validation tests for unlikely inputs (NaN, Infinity, tab-only strings) are low value
  - Tests that just verify "function was called" without validating behavior are problematic
  - 5 tests marked for removal, 22 for review, ~111 to keep
  - **Critical recommendation**: walletService.test.ts should be deleted or completely rewritten

## 2026-01-21 - US-003: Audit Validation Tests for Meaningfulness
- What was implemented:
  - Read and analyzed all 7 validation test files (~268 tests total, excluding fuzz tests)
  - Identified tests with weak assertions (toBeTruthy, toBeDefined, toBe(true/false) without error checks)
  - Created tasks/cleanup-validation.md with comprehensive analysis
- Files changed:
  - tasks/cleanup-validation.md (created)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - session.test.ts is exemplary - uses `toThrow('exact error message')` pattern consistently
  - Best practice: replace `expect(result.isValid).toBe(false)` with error message verification
  - Fuzz-like property tests (checking types only) are acceptable for exhaustive input coverage
  - Validation tests should check specific error messages, not just boolean results
  - simple.test.ts and amount.test.ts need the most work (~15 weak assertions combined)
  - 32 weak assertions identified across all files, 28 tests marked REVIEW, 0 marked REMOVE
  - All tests test meaningful behavior - just need stronger assertions

## 2026-01-21 - US-004: Audit Storage Tests for Usefulness
- What was implemented:
  - Read and analyzed all 8 storage test files (~126 tests total)
  - Calculated Usefulness Score for each test
  - Created tasks/cleanup-storage.md with comprehensive analysis
- Files changed:
  - tasks/cleanup-storage.md (created)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - mutex.test.ts is exemplary - tests concurrency-critical code with thorough serialization tests
  - walletStorage.test.ts has excellent validation tests checking data integrity (version, salt, encryptedKeychain, kdf.iterations)
  - keyStorage.test.ts has good independence tests for security-critical key storage
  - Tests using `fakeBrowser` from wxt/testing are better than manual mocks
  - serviceKeepAlive tests only verify "doesn't throw" - no meaningful assertion (Score 4)
  - 4 tests marked for removal, 12 for review, ~110 to keep
  - **Strength**: Most storage tests verify persistence through round-trip tests (save → retrieve)
  - **Weakness**: Some tests for unlikely scenarios (empty storage operations, edge values) provide low value

## 2026-01-21 - US-005: Audit Blockchain/Bitcoin Tests for Meaningfulness
- What was implemented:
  - Read and analyzed all 19 blockchain/bitcoin test files (~400+ tests total)
  - Identified tests with weak assertions on crypto operations
  - Created tasks/cleanup-blockchain.md with comprehensive analysis
- Files changed:
  - tasks/cleanup-blockchain.md (created)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Blockchain tests are EXCELLENT overall - the highest quality test suite in the codebase
  - BIP-322 tests use official test vectors and verify exact signature outputs
  - PSBT tests verify signature presence, input/output counts, and finalization behavior
  - Tests use real cryptographic libraries (@noble/secp256k1, @scure/btc-signer), not mocks
  - One P2TR test is skipped (documented limitation - requires specific schnorr key fixtures)
  - Few type-only assertions (e.g., `typeof result === 'string'`) are acceptable for non-deterministic crypto output
  - Tests cover all address formats: P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2SH-P2WPKH, P2TR
  - **No cleanup required** - blockchain tests are well-designed with strong assertions
  - Network/API tests (balance, blockHeight, feeRate, price) have good fallback coverage

## 2026-01-21 - US-006: Compile Cleanup Summary
- What was implemented:
  - Read all 5 cleanup audit documents (cleanup-hooks.md, cleanup-services.md, cleanup-validation.md, cleanup-storage.md, cleanup-blockchain.md)
  - Created tasks/cleanup-summary.md with prioritized cleanup actions
  - Organized tests by action type: REMOVE, STRENGTHEN, REFACTOR
  - Prioritized by effort level: Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L)
- Files changed:
  - tasks/cleanup-summary.md (created)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Total ~1,010 tests analyzed across all test suites
  - 18 tests to REMOVE (Score < 10) - mostly React behavior tests and empty test bodies
  - 14 assertions to STRENGTHEN - mostly validation tests that check `toBe(false)` without error messages
  - 1 file to DELETE entirely: walletService.test.ts (24 tests that only verify mock behavior)
  - Blockchain tests require NO cleanup - highest quality test suite
  - session.test.ts, mutex.test.ts, and walletStorage.test.ts are exemplary models to follow
  - Cleanup phases: Quick wins (18 removals + 4 security assertions), Assertion cleanup (10 assertions), Major refactoring (walletService)
